# billal3110.github.io

Personal website for Muhammed Billal (Dhaka, Bangladesh).

Files:
- `index.html` - homepage (uses `profile.jpg` as the profile photo)
- `styles.css` - styles
- `images/` - optional folder for local badge/skill images

What I added
- New "Experience" section with your full professional history (roles, companies, dates, bullets).
- Navigation link to jump to Experience.
- Badges & Achievements cards (TryHackMe, Google Skills, Google Dev, Credly) and social links.

How to update or publish
1. Add images:
   - Profile photo: save your photo as `profile.jpg` in the repo root.
   - Badges/images: place them in `images/` (e.g., `images/google-skills.png`, `images/gdev.png`, `images/credly-intro-cyber.png`) or keep remote URLs.
2. Commit & push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Experience section and update site"
   git push
   ```
3. Your site will be live at:
   - https://billal3110.github.io

Next suggestions (pick any):
- Create a printable Resume page or a downloadable PDF (I can generate a simple resume PDF from this data).
- Re-order or expand bullet points, add technologies/skills for each role.
- Add a "Skills" section listing technical skills and proficiency.
- Optimize and host all badge images locally and produce a zip for direct upload.

Which would you like next? I can generate a downloadable PDF resume, make a separate resume page, or add a skills section with icons and proficiency levels.
